# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection - Streamlit App

This is a machine learning project built with Python and Streamlit that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized financial data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Detecting fraudulent transactions is a major challenge in the financial industry. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can detect fraud based on transaction features.

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset used is from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- Highly imbalanced: 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

## 🧠 Model

- Model: Logistic Regression / Random Forest (as per your choice)
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler for feature scaling
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🖥️ App Features

- Enter values for anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`) and `Amount`
- Get instant prediction: Fraud or Not Fraud
- Built with Streamlit

## 🚀 Deployment

- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud
- [🔗 Live Demo](https://credit-card-fraud-detector-h3z4byb7wendyv3w8ytzbk.streamlit.app/)
